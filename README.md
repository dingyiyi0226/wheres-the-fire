## A public platform for wildfire detection and prevention.


## Motivation
* According to Veriskâ€™s 2017 Wildfire Risk Analysis, losses from wildfires added up to $5.1 billion over the past 10 years, and over 4.5 million U.S. houses are at high risk of wildfire.
NASA has a near real-time wildfire information database (Fire Information for Resource Management System, FIRMS), but it is neither widely-known nor easy-to-use for public.
* Compared with NASA's satellite data, reports from public users can be more precise and immediate. Thus we combines these two resources in this "Where's the Fire" platform.

## Features
* NASA's FIRMS database
> * FIRMS provides a wide variety of wildfire data classified by location, time, etc. Since observed by satellites, wildfire in remote region can be recorded as well. 
> * Our project image shows data (South-east Asia, 2018/10/20 one-day data) from FIRMS.

* Intuitive User report system
> * Asides from data from FIRMS, each user's reports play a crucial role in our platform. 
> * To report data, users have to report his or her current location, azimuth toward fire, description, and photos. Current location is easily obtained through GPS on mobiles or wifi-locating on laptops. Azimuth toward fire is a north-based azimuth angle which is the relative direction of wildfire at the user's viewpoint. Descriptions and photos allow users to give more details to others. 
> * Once receiving reports from users, our program will then classify all reports into "fire events" based on our statistical method. 

* Wildfire prevention and alarm
> * By locating wildfire spots, people living near these locations can take precaution in advanced to minimize possible damages. 
> * Authorities(e.g. fire stations) can use this website to get a rough understanding about how wildfire distributes in their jurisdictions when there's no complete observation data about the wildfire.

## Impact
* For residents living in wildfire-threatened area, this platform helps them take precautions earlier.
* For NASA, this platform visualizes their scientific data to public and allows users to interact with it.
* For those who are unlikely to be affected by wildfire. They can still understand the impact of wildfire all around the world, and raise the public awareness of natural disaster.
